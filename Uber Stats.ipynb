    "### Questions for Uber Passengers/Riders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ride Availability and Popular Routes**:\n",
    "   - What are the most common routes (ZIP code to ZIP code) that you drive? How does this information reflect on ride availability in certain areas?\n",
    "   - Are there specific ZIP codes with higher frequency of pickups or dropoffs during certain times? This could indicate busy areas and times for riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost and Distance Analysis**:\n",
    "   - What is the average cost per mile or per minute for different ride types? This could help riders understand pricing better.\n",
    "   - How does the cost of a trip vary by distance or duration? Are there patterns that might suggest more cost-effective options for riders?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ride Type Preferences**:\n",
    "   - Which ride types are most popular in your area? Do certain ZIP codes favor specific ride types, like UberX Share or Comfort?\n",
    "   - How does the popularity of ride types change over time, and what might this suggest about rider preferences?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timing and Convenience**:\n",
    "   - What are the most and least busy times of day for trips? This could help riders decide when to request a ride for the shortest wait times.\n",
    "   - Is there a noticeable difference in trip duration during peak hours versus off-peak hours? How does this affect the rider experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tip Behavior Insights**:\n",
    "   - How often do riders tip, and how does the tip amount vary by ride type and trip characteristics (like distance or time of day)?\n",
    "   - Are there trends in tipping behavior that could inform riders about what others are tipping for similar rides?"
